MongoDB is a document database. It stores data in a type of JSON format called BSON.
A record in MongoDB is a document, which is a data structure composed of key value pairs similar to the structure of JSON objects.
Example Document: 
{
	title: "Post Title 1",
	body: "Body of post.",
	category: "News",
	likes: 1,
	tags: ["news", "events"],
	date: Date()
}
