Node.js is a free, open-source JavaScript runtime that runs on Windows, Mac, Linux, and more.

It lets you execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser, enabling server-side development with JavaScript.

Built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js is designed for building scalable network applications efficiently.
Node.js excels at handling many simultaneous connections with minimal overhead, making it perfect for:

Real-time applications (chats, gaming, collaboration tools)
APIs and microservices
Data streaming applications
Command-line tools
Server-side web applications
Its non-blocking, event-driven architecture makes it highly efficient for I/O-heavy workloads.

Node.js uses asynchronous (non-blocking) programming.

This means it can keep working while waiting for tasks like reading files or talking to a database.

With asynchronous code, Node.js can handle many things at once—making it fast and efficient.
